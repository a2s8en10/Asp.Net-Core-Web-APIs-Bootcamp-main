# What is HTTP

- HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol.
- HTTP is used for communication between the client and the server.
- It is like a language that allows your web browser (like Chrome or Firefox) to talk to the websites you want to visit. It's the basic set of rules that let your computer ask for information from a website's server and receive it back so you can see web pages, pictures, videos, and more on your screen. So, whenever you click a link, type in a web address, or submit a form online, you're using HTTP to make that happen. It's the foundation of how we browse the internet!
